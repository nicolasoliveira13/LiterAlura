### An application that consumes the Gutendex API - https://gutendex.com/

<br>This API that searches for books and returns data such as Authors, Languages, and Download Counts.

<br>The application uses a PostgreSQL database.
<br>The menu gives us the option to search for the desired book, add the data to the database and display the registered books and authors.
It is also possible to choose to show living authors in a specific year or books in a specific language.
